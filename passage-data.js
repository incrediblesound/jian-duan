In the past and today it is the same.<br> Only when the dragon is in water is its spirit manifest.<br> The tiger and leopard must be in dark valleys for their fearsomeness to manifest.<br> Wind and rain have no village, yet anger and hatred never meet them.<br> Respected people must give orders, humble people must forget their poverty.<br> Long life, early death, wealth and poverty, these things have no cause(?)'
