What on earth has brought you here?<br>Qu Yuan said: "this generation is muddy, I alone am clear,<br>The masses are all drunk, I alone am sober. This is why I have been exiled."<br>The fisherman replied: "Sages do not get caught up in things, instead they are able to rearrange things.<br>The generation is dirty, so play in the mud and make waves. Everyone is drunk, so eat and drink with them.<br> Why would you use deep thoughts to elevate yourself, and thereby exile yourself?"<br>Qu Yuan replied: "I have heard that a man who has just washed his head must clean his hat, and a man who has just bathed must air out his robes.<br> Could I take my clean body and go recieve the filth of the world?<br>I would rather go to the flowing Xiang and bury myself in the belly of a river fish.<br>Can I take my pure white mind and cover it in the dirt of the vulgar masses?<br>The fisherman smiled, and then he laughed. He picked up his oar and paddled away.<br> As he was leaving he began to sing:"when the Canglang waters are clean, I can wash my hat there.<br> When the Canglang waters are dirty, I can wash my feet there."<br> He was never seen again.'
